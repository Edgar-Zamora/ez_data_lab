👋 I'm a Senior Technical Consultant for [Allovue](https://www.powerschool.com/solutions/resource-planning/) (A Powerschool company) where I extract, transform, and load K-12 data to allow our customers to make decisions about the direction of their district. Currently open to exploring other opportunities of employment so feel free to reach me.

Outside of work am an avid gamer, sports fan (Kraken 🦑, Manchester City ⚽️, and New York Yankees ⚾️), and love spending time with my cats 🐈🐈‍⬛.
